Nubase is a highly-opinionated full-stack framework for creating internal tools and business applications.

## What is Nubase?

Nubase is a configuration-based framework that generates fully functional applications from schema definitions. Instead of manually coding routes, API calls, forms, and navigation, you define:

1. **Schemas** using `@nubase/core`
2. **View configurations** that reference these schemas
3. **Resource operations** (create, view, edit, etc.)
4. **Main menu structure**
5. **API endpoints and theme preferences**

The framework then automatically generates a complete application with:
- Consistent UI
- Proper routing
- Type safety
- Theme support

## Core Packages

Nubase consists of two main packages:

- **@nubase/core** - Core schema system with Zod-based validation, computed metadata, and layout definitions
- **@nubase/frontend** - React components, form controls, and hooks for building Nubase applications

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started is to create a new Nubase app:

```bash
npx @nubase/create my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new project with everything configured and ready to go.
