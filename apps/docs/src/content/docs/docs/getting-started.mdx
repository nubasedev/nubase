This guide will help you get started with Nubase by walking you through the process of creating your first application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ (we recommend using the latest LTS version)
- **npm** or **pnpm** package manager
- **Docker** (for running the database)

## Quick Start

Clone the Nubase repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nubasedev/nubase.git
cd nubase
npm install
```

A Nubase project has the following structure:

```
my-app/
├── frontend/          # React frontend application
├── backend/           # Node.js backend with Hono
├── schema/            # Shared TypeScript schema definitions
├── nubase/            # Database configuration and migrations
├── package.json       # Root package.json with workspace configuration
└── turbo.json         # Turborepo configuration
```

The `nubase/` folder contains your database configuration, migrations, and schema snapshots. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for details.

## Starting the Development Server

1. **Start the database**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:up
   ```

2. **Seed the database** (optional, for sample data):
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

3. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start:
- Frontend at `http://localhost:3002`
- Backend at `http://localhost:3001`

## Project Structure

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

The frontend is a React application using Vite. Key files:

- `src/config/config.ts` - Main application configuration
- `src/main.tsx` - Application entry point
- `src/resources/` - Resource definitions

### Backend (`backend/`)

The backend is a Node.js application using Hono. Key files:

- `src/index.ts` - Server entry point
- `src/api/routes/` - API route handlers
- `src/db/` - Database schema and connections

### Schema (`schema/`)

Shared TypeScript definitions used by both frontend and backend:

- `src/schema/` - One folder per resource (e.g., `auth/`, `ticket/`)
  - Each folder contains one file per schema (base schemas and request schemas)
  - Each folder has an `index.ts` that re-exports all schemas
- `src/api-endpoints.ts` - Aggregated API endpoints from all resources

## Next Steps

- Learn about the [Schema System](/docs/schema) to understand how to define your data models
- Explore [Resources](/docs/resources) to see how to create CRUD operations
- Check out the [Frontend Configuration](/docs/frontend) for customizing your application
